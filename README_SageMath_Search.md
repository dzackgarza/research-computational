# SageMath Documentation Search Project

The **SageMath Documentation Search** project has been moved to its own organized directory:

## 📁 Location

```
Research_Files/sagemath_doc_search/
```

## 🚀 Quick Access

```bash
cd sagemath_doc_search
streamlit run HayStack_Doc_Search_v3.py
```

## 📖 Documentation

See the project's main documentation:
- **[sagemath_doc_search/README.md](sagemath_doc_search/README.md)** - Main project overview
- **[sagemath_doc_search/USAGE.md](sagemath_doc_search/USAGE.md)** - Detailed usage guide

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 AI-powered search through SageMath documentation
- 🔗 Clickable citations with line numbers
- 📍 Direct links to GitHub or local files
- 🚀 Fast startup with pre-built index
- 🤖 Multiple LLM provider support

## 🎯 What It Does

This system allows you to ask questions like:
- "How do I compute invariants of an integer lattice?"
- "What is a Coxeter group in SageMath?"
- "How do I work with elliptic curves?"

And get answers with **clickable citations** that link directly to the relevant SageMath source code with specific line numbers.
